=== Serial multiplexer === 

The following code is a small C code, which creates 2 virtual serial ports and feeds the data to
one physical port, and back. This was needed in order to talk to the arduino from both HeyU and boblight,
without doing major protocol modifications to both.

Use at your own risk!
